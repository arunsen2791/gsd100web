                    GSD100 is an online discovery platform plus an e-commerce
                    platform. Here you can search for clothes, or you can search
                    for specific shops. Go to shop profiles and check out which
                    products are listed for online shopping. You can check out
                    the shop profile and then pay a visit for the “look and
                    feel” of the clothes. You can view reviews and ratings of
                    other customers before you buy. You can expect SMS
                    communication from the shops once you have made a
                    transaction.
