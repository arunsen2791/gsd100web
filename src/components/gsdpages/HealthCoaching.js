                        Health coaches are trained professionals who can help
                        you create lasting mental and physical changes. Using
                        their knowledge of health and wellness, they empower you
                        to take charge of your health by identifying areas for
                        improvement and providing support and encouragement as
                        you work toward your goals. They can also help you
                        navigate the medical system and stay the course with
                        your treatment if you have a serious or chronic illness.

                          What is a health coach versus a nutritionist? The main
                          difference is that a nutritionist focuses entirely on
                          your diet, prescribing specific diets and meal plans.
                          Nutritionists are not doctors, but patients are often
                          referred to them by doctors, and they may use
                          bloodwork and lab tests in order to develop the
                          guidelines they recommend.
